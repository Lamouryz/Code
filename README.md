### Associative learning mechanism for drug-target interaction prediction

-----------

The molecular characterization learning part is composed of an improved variational automatic encoder, and the feature extraction part is composed of convolution layer and transformer module. The interactive learning part uses the method of self-attention to fuse the dual-channel features. Thanks to variational automatic coding, new information can be obtained by using similar structure as decoder.
